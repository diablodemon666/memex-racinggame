# Requirements Document: Asset System Implementation

## Context
The Memex Racing game currently uses mock data and placeholder assets throughout the game systems. While a comprehensive AssetManager class exists, it's not integrated with the actual game assets located in `src/assets/maps/tracks/` and `src/assets/maps/backgrounds/`. The game needs a complete asset loading system that replaces mock data with real assets and provides efficient, cached access to game resources during gameplay.

## Stakeholders
- **Primary**: Game players who need fast loading times and visual consistency
- **Secondary**: Developers who need reliable asset management and hot reload support
- **Tertiary**: System administrators concerned with bandwidth and storage optimization

## Requirements

### REQ-001: Real Asset Loading System
**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to load real map textures and sprites so that I have a visually rich gaming experience

**EARS Syntax:**
- When the game initializes, the system shall load real track and background assets from the filesystem
- While assets are loading, when the loading process is active, the system shall display progress feedback
- If an asset fails to load, then the system shall use fallback assets and log the error

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Real Asset Loading
  Scenario: Load track assets on game start
    Given the game is initializing
    When the asset system starts loading
    Then real track images should be loaded from src/assets/maps/tracks/
    And real background images should be loaded from src/assets/maps/backgrounds/
    And loading progress should be displayed to the user

  Scenario: Handle missing assets gracefully
    Given a required asset file is missing
    When the asset system attempts to load it
    Then a fallback asset should be used instead
    And an error should be logged for debugging
    And the game should continue functioning normally
```

**Priority**: High
**Dependencies**: None

### REQ-002: Asset Caching and Performance Optimization
**User Story:** As a player, I want fast asset loading and smooth gameplay so that I don't experience delays or stuttering

**EARS Syntax:**
- When assets are loaded, the system shall cache them in memory for quick access
- While the game is running, when assets are requested, the system shall serve from cache when available
- If memory usage exceeds limits, then the system shall evict least recently used assets

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Asset Caching and Performance
  Scenario: Cache loaded assets for reuse
    Given an asset has been loaded once
    When the same asset is requested again
    Then it should be served from cache
    And loading time should be under 10ms
    And no network or disk access should occur

  Scenario: Memory management under load
    Given the asset cache is approaching memory limits
    When new assets need to be loaded
    Then least recently used assets should be evicted
    And memory usage should stay within configured limits
    And critical assets should not be evicted
```

**Priority**: High
**Dependencies**: REQ-001

### REQ-003: Hot Reload Support for Development
**User Story:** As a developer, I want asset changes to be reflected immediately during development so that I can iterate quickly on visual design

**EARS Syntax:**
- When asset files are modified during development, the system shall detect changes automatically
- While in development mode, when assets are updated, the system shall reload them without restarting the game
- If hot reload fails, then the system shall log the error and continue with cached assets

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Hot Reload for Development
  Scenario: Automatic asset reload on file change
    Given the game is running in development mode
    When an asset file is modified on disk
    Then the asset should be automatically reloaded
    And the game should reflect the changes immediately
    And no manual refresh should be required

  Scenario: Hot reload error handling
    Given an asset file becomes corrupted during development
    When the hot reload system attempts to reload it
    Then an error should be logged with details
    And the previous version should continue to be used
    And the developer should be notified of the issue
```

**Priority**: Medium
**Dependencies**: REQ-001, REQ-002

### REQ-004: Asset Validation and Quality Assurance
**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure all assets meet game requirements so that visual consistency is maintained

**EARS Syntax:**
- When assets are loaded, the system shall validate dimensions, format, and quality requirements
- If an asset doesn't meet specifications, then the system shall log validation errors
- While in development mode, when validation fails, the system shall provide detailed feedback

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Asset Validation
  Scenario: Validate track dimensions
    Given a track asset is being loaded
    When the validation system checks it
    Then it should verify the image is properly sized for game rendering
    And it should check that collision areas are properly defined
    And validation results should be logged

  Scenario: Format compliance checking
    Given assets with various formats are loaded
    When format validation runs
    Then only supported formats (PNG, JPG) should be accepted
    And unsupported formats should be rejected with clear errors
    And fallback assets should be used for rejected assets
```

**Priority**: Medium
**Dependencies**: REQ-001

### REQ-005: Asset Preloading and Progressive Loading
**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to start quickly and continue loading assets in the background so that I don't wait for unnecessary resources

**EARS Syntax:**
- When the game starts, the system shall load critical assets first for immediate gameplay
- While the game is playable, when background loading occurs, the system shall load non-critical assets
- If the player requests an asset that's still loading, then the system shall prioritize that asset

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Progressive Asset Loading
  Scenario: Critical assets loaded first
    Given the game is starting up
    When asset loading begins
    Then player sprites and UI elements should load first
    And the game should become playable as soon as critical assets are ready
    And non-critical assets should continue loading in background

  Scenario: On-demand asset prioritization
    Given the game is running with background loading active
    When a player requests a specific map or feature
    Then assets for that feature should be prioritized
    And loading should complete before the feature is used
    And other background loading should be temporarily paused if needed
```

**Priority**: Medium
**Dependencies**: REQ-001, REQ-002

### REQ-006: Asset Organization and Discovery
**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear asset organization system so that I can easily manage and locate game resources

**EARS Syntax:**
- When the asset system initializes, the system shall scan and catalog all available assets
- While organizing assets, when duplicates are found, the system shall log warnings
- If asset naming conflicts exist, then the system shall use resolution priority rules

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Asset Organization
  Scenario: Automatic asset discovery
    Given assets exist in the configured directories
    When the asset system initializes
    Then all assets should be automatically discovered and cataloged
    And asset metadata should be generated for each resource
    And missing assets should be identified and reported

  Scenario: Conflict resolution
    Given multiple assets have the same name
    When the asset system loads them
    Then priority rules should determine which asset to use
    And conflicts should be logged for developer attention
    And the chosen asset should be consistently used throughout the game
```

**Priority**: Low
**Dependencies**: REQ-001

## System Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Must integrate with existing AssetManager class without breaking changes
- Must support Phaser.js asset loading patterns and requirements
- Must work with webpack asset processing and optimization
- Must maintain compatibility with existing mock asset system during transition

### Performance Constraints
- Asset loading must not block game initialization beyond 3 seconds
- Memory usage for cached assets must not exceed 200MB
- Hot reload must complete within 2 seconds for development workflow
- Critical asset loading must complete within 1 second

### Storage Constraints
- Total asset size must not exceed 100MB for initial download
- Individual assets must not exceed 5MB to ensure reasonable loading times
- Asset compression must maintain visual quality while optimizing size
- Progressive loading must prioritize assets by usage frequency

### Browser Constraints
- Must work with modern browsers supporting HTML5 Canvas and WebGL
- Must handle browsers with limited memory gracefully
- Must support both desktop and mobile device asset loading
- Must work with various network connection speeds

## Success Criteria

1. **Complete Asset Integration**: All mock assets replaced with real assets from filesystem
2. **Performance Compliance**: Asset loading meets all specified performance targets
3. **Development Efficiency**: Hot reload enables rapid iteration for developers
4. **Quality Assurance**: All assets validated and meet game visual standards
5. **Memory Management**: Efficient caching with proper memory usage limits
6. **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of missing or corrupted assets

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Large Asset Size**: Could cause long loading times and poor user experience
- **Memory Leaks**: Improper asset cleanup could cause performance degradation
- **Missing Assets**: Could break game functionality if fallbacks don't work

### Medium Risk
- **Hot Reload Complexity**: Could interfere with game state during development
- **Format Incompatibility**: Assets might not work with Phaser.js requirements
- **Cache Invalidation**: Stale cached assets could cause visual inconsistencies

### Low Risk
- **Asset Organization**: Poorly organized assets could complicate maintenance
- **Validation Overhead**: Extensive validation could slow down loading
- **Browser Compatibility**: Some older browsers might have asset loading issues
