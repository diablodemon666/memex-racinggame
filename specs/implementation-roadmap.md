- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Regular security scanning and compliance checks

### Performance-Driven Architecture  
Each phase optimizes for:
- 60 FPS gameplay experience
- Sub-100ms database query response
- Efficient memory management
- Network optimization for multiplayer
- Progressive asset loading

### Scalability Planning
Architecture designed for:
- Horizontal scaling of application servers
- Database read replicas for query distribution
- CDN integration for global asset delivery
- Auto-scaling based on user load
- Multi-region deployment capability

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Week 1 Risks
- **Risk**: Breaking existing functionality during security fixes
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test coverage, staged rollout, rollback plan

- **Risk**: Database migration complexity
- **Mitigation**: Reversible migrations, staging environment testing

### Month 1 Risks
- **Risk**: Multiplayer complexity and synchronization issues
- **Mitigation**: Incremental implementation, extensive testing

- **Risk**: Performance degradation with new features
- **Mitigation**: Performance monitoring, quality gates in CI/CD

### Quarter 1 Risks
- **Risk**: Infrastructure complexity and operational overhead
- **Mitigation**: Gradual scaling, comprehensive monitoring, automation

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Write failing tests first (Red phase)
- Implement minimal code to pass (Green phase)  
- Refactor for quality (Refactor phase)
- Maintain 85%+ test coverage

### Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
- Gherkin scenarios for all user stories
- Acceptance criteria validation
- End-to-end testing of user journeys
- Business stakeholder involvement

### Performance Testing
- Load testing at each phase
- Performance regression detection
- Memory leak monitoring
- Response time validation
