# Requirements Document: Authentication Integration Fixes

## Context
The authentication system has been implemented but critical integration issues prevent the game from functioning properly. The validation report shows that scene integration is incomplete, authentication flow is broken, and 23 tests are failing. This is blocking production deployment.

## Stakeholders
- Primary: Game developers, end users
- Secondary: System administrators, quality assurance team

## Requirements

### REQ-001: Complete Scene Authentication Integration
**User Story:** As a player, I want all game scenes to properly recognize my authentication status so that I can access authenticated features consistently.

**EARS Syntax:**
- When a user is authenticated, the MainMenuScene shall use AuthGameBridge instead of window.authManager
- When a scene starts, all game scenes shall extend AuthenticatedScene base class
- When user context changes, all active scenes shall receive updated authentication state

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Scene Authentication Integration
  Scenario: MainMenuScene uses AuthGameBridge
    Given a user is authenticated
    When MainMenuScene is loaded
    Then it should use AuthGameBridge for authentication operations
    And it should not use window.authManager

  Scenario: All scenes extend AuthenticatedScene
    Given any game scene is loaded
    When the scene initializes
    Then it should extend AuthenticatedScene
    And it should have access to user context methods

  Scenario: Authentication state propagation
    Given user authentication state changes
    When the change occurs
    Then all active scenes should receive the updated state
    And UI should reflect the new authentication status
```

Priority: High
Dependencies: None

### REQ-002: Fix Authentication Flow
**User Story:** As a player, I want the login process to properly redirect me to the game after successful authentication so that I can start playing immediately.

**EARS Syntax:**
- When a user successfully logs in, the system shall redirect them to the game interface
- When authentication fails, the system shall provide clear error feedback
- When a session expires during gameplay, the system shall handle it gracefully

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Authentication Flow
  Scenario: Successful login redirect
    Given a user enters valid credentials
    When they click login
    Then they should be redirected to the game
    And their user context should be available

  Scenario: Failed login handling
    Given a user enters invalid credentials
    When they click login
    Then they should see an error message
    And they should remain on the login page

  Scenario: Session expiration handling
    Given a user is playing the game
    When their session expires
    Then they should be gracefully logged out
    And redirected to the login page with a message
```

Priority: High
Dependencies: REQ-001

### REQ-003: Integrate Multiplayer with Authentication
**User Story:** As a player, I want multiplayer functionality to use my authenticated identity so that other players can identify me correctly and my actions are properly attributed.

**EARS Syntax:**
- When a user joins a multiplayer room, the system shall use their authenticated user ID
- When multiplayer events occur, the system shall validate user permissions
- When displaying player information, the system shall use authenticated user data

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Authenticated Multiplayer
  Scenario: Multiplayer connection with authenticated identity
    Given a user is authenticated
    When they join a multiplayer game
    Then their authenticated username should be displayed
    And their user ID should be used for all multiplayer operations

  Scenario: Permission validation in multiplayer
    Given a user attempts a multiplayer action
    When the action requires specific permissions
    Then the system should validate user permissions
    And deny access if permissions are insufficient

  Scenario: Player identification in rooms
    Given multiple authenticated users are in a room
    When viewing the player list
    Then each player should be identified by their authenticated username
    And host status should be properly indicated
```

Priority: High
Dependencies: REQ-001, REQ-002

### REQ-004: Resolve Test Failures
**User Story:** As a developer, I want all authentication tests to pass so that the system is reliable and deployment-ready.

**EARS Syntax:**
- When tests are run, the authentication system tests shall pass completely
- When configuration issues exist, the system shall provide clear error messages
- When encryption operations fail, the system shall handle them gracefully

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Test Suite Reliability
  Scenario: Password validation tests pass
    Given the password validator is configured correctly
    When password validation tests are run
    Then all validation tests should pass
    And password strength calculations should be accurate

  Scenario: Storage manager encryption tests pass
    Given the encryption system is properly configured
    When storage manager tests are run
    Then crypto operations should work correctly
    And encryption keys should be generated properly

  Scenario: Integration tests pass
    Given all components are properly integrated
    When integration tests are run
    Then authentication flow tests should pass
    And multiplayer integration tests should pass
```

Priority: High
Dependencies: REQ-001, REQ-002, REQ-003

### REQ-005: Error Handling and Recovery
**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to handle authentication errors gracefully so that I don't lose progress or encounter confusing error states.

**EARS Syntax:**
- When authentication errors occur, the system shall provide user-friendly error messages
- When network connectivity is lost, the system shall attempt recovery
- When critical errors occur, the system shall preserve user progress where possible

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Error Handling and Recovery
  Scenario: Network connectivity loss
    Given a user is playing an authenticated game
    When network connectivity is lost
    Then the system should attempt to reconnect
    And display appropriate status messages

  Scenario: Authentication error during gameplay
    Given a user is in the middle of a game
    When an authentication error occurs
    Then the system should gracefully handle the error
    And preserve game progress where possible

  Scenario: Recovery from temporary failures
    Given a temporary authentication failure occurs
    When the system detects the failure
    Then it should attempt automatic recovery
    And notify the user of the recovery attempt
```

Priority: Medium
Dependencies: REQ-001, REQ-002

## Success Criteria
- All scenes properly integrated with authentication system
- Login flow works correctly with proper redirects
- Multiplayer system uses authenticated user data
- All authentication tests pass (0 failures)
- Error scenarios are handled gracefully
- System is deployment-ready

## Technical Constraints
- Must maintain existing API contracts
- Must not break existing user sessions
- Performance impact must be minimal (< 100ms additional initialization time)
- Must work with existing JWT-based authentication
- Must be compatible with current Phaser.js game engine

## Security Requirements
- User data must be properly sanitized before display
- JWT tokens must never be exposed to game logic
- Permission checks must be enforced for all sensitive operations
- Session validation must occur before critical operations
