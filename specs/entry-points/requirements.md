# Requirements Document: Entry Point Files

## Context
The Memex Racing game project has an established webpack configuration and modular architecture structure, but lacks the fundamental entry point files required for the build system to function. These files serve as the bridge between the webpack build process and the game's modular architecture.

## Stakeholders
- Primary: Game developers working on modularization
- Secondary: Build system maintainers, content creators using development tools

## Requirements

### REQ-001: HTML Entry Point Template
**User Story:** As a developer, I want a minimal HTML template so that webpack can generate the game's main HTML file with proper Phaser.js configuration.

**EARS Syntax:**
- When webpack builds the project, the system shall use public/index.html as the template
- The HTML template shall include viewport configuration for responsive pixel art rendering
- The HTML template shall include proper meta tags for game optimization
- The HTML template shall provide a container element for the Phaser.js game canvas

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: HTML Entry Point Template
  Scenario: Webpack processes HTML template
    Given webpack configuration is set to use public/index.html as template
    When the build process runs
    Then the HTML file should be generated with proper structure
    And the HTML should include viewport meta tag
    And the HTML should include a game container element
    And the HTML should have proper title injection from webpack
    
  Scenario: Game loads properly in browser
    Given the HTML template is processed by webpack
    When the page loads in a web browser
    Then the game container should be available for Phaser.js
    And no console errors should occur related to missing elements
```

Priority: High
Dependencies: None

### REQ-002: JavaScript Entry Point Module
**User Story:** As a developer, I want a main JavaScript entry point so that webpack can bundle the modular game architecture into a working application.

**EARS Syntax:**
- When webpack builds the project, the system shall use src/index.js as the main entry point
- The entry point shall import and initialize the game engine modules
- The entry point shall handle environment configuration and setup
- The entry point shall provide error boundaries for production deployment
- The entry point shall support hot module replacement for development

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: JavaScript Entry Point Module
  Scenario: Webpack bundles application
    Given src/index.js exists as the main entry point
    When webpack processes the build
    Then all game modules should be properly imported
    And the bundle should be generated without errors
    And module aliases should resolve correctly
    
  Scenario: Game initializes in browser
    Given the bundled JavaScript loads
    When the page loads
    Then the game should initialize without errors
    And Phaser.js should create the game instance
    And the game should be ready for user interaction
    
  Scenario: Development hot-reload works
    Given the development server is running
    When source files are modified
    Then the application should hot-reload
    And the game state should be preserved where possible
```

Priority: High
Dependencies: None

### REQ-003: Environment Configuration Support
**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment-aware initialization so that the game behaves appropriately in development vs production.

**EARS Syntax:**
- When running in development mode, the system shall enable debug features
- When running in production mode, the system shall optimize performance
- The entry point shall configure Phaser.js settings based on environment
- The entry point shall handle error reporting appropriately per environment

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Environment Configuration
  Scenario: Development mode initialization
    Given NODE_ENV is set to development
    When the game initializes
    Then debug features should be enabled
    And verbose logging should be active
    And hot-reload should be configured
    
  Scenario: Production mode initialization
    Given NODE_ENV is set to production
    When the game initializes
    Then performance optimizations should be enabled
    And minimal logging should be active
    And error handling should be robust
```

Priority: Medium
Dependencies: REQ-002

### REQ-004: Asset Loading Integration
**User Story:** As a developer, I want the entry point to work with the existing asset structure so that game assets load properly.

**EARS Syntax:**
- The entry point shall be compatible with webpack's asset handling rules
- The system shall support the existing src/assets folder structure
- The entry point shall handle asset preloading for optimal performance
- The system shall work with webpack's copy plugin for data assets

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Asset Loading Integration
  Scenario: Asset paths resolve correctly
    Given assets are structured in src/assets/
    When the game requests assets
    Then webpack should resolve asset paths correctly
    And assets should be available at runtime
    
  Scenario: Data folder copying works
    Given data/ folder contains game configurations
    When webpack builds the project
    Then data files should be copied to dist/data/
    And runtime access to data should work
```

Priority: Medium
Dependencies: REQ-002

## Technical Constraints
- Must work with existing webpack.config.js without modifications
- Must be compatible with Phaser.js 3.60.0
- Must support ES6 modules and webpack aliases
- Must work with existing package.json scripts
- Must maintain compatibility with existing src/ folder structure

## Performance Requirements
- Initial page load should be under 3 seconds on standard connections
- Bundle size impact should be minimal (entry files should be lightweight)
- Asset loading should not block initial game initialization
- Hot-reload should complete within 2 seconds during development

## Security Considerations
- No execution of untrusted code in entry points
- Proper error boundaries to prevent crashes
- Environment variables should not expose sensitive information
- Content Security Policy compatibility
