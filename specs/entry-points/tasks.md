### TASK-007: Implement Hot Module Replacement Support
- **Status**: ⏳ pending
- **Description**: Add HMR hooks and game state preservation for development workflow

  - Development-only HMR code
- **TDD Process**:
  1. Write tests for HMR hook registration and state preservation
  2. Implement basic HMR acceptance with module.hot API
  3. Refactor to preserve relevant game state across reloads
- **Acceptance Test**:
  ```gherkin
  Given the development server is running with HMR
  When source files are modified
  Then the application should hot-reload
  And relevant game state should be preserved
  And the game should continue functioning normally
  ```
- Dependencies: TASK-006

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (TASK-001 to TASK-003)
Create the basic structure and configuration system that everything else builds upon. Focus on getting webpack to recognize and process the entry files correctly.

### Phase 2: Game Integration (TASK-004 to TASK-005)
Integrate with Phaser.js and the asset system to create a working game initialization pipeline.

### Phase 3: Robustness (TASK-006 to TASK-007)
Add error handling and development tools to make the system production-ready and developer-friendly.

### Phase 4: Validation (TASK-008)
Comprehensive testing to ensure everything works together with the existing codebase and webpack configuration.

## Quality Checkpoints

After each task completion:
1. **Webpack Build**: Verify successful build without errors
2. **Browser Loading**: Test game loading in development browser
3. **Code Quality**: Ensure proper error handling and clean code
4. **Integration**: Verify compatibility with existing project structure

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues:
- **Webpack Compatibility**: Existing configuration may need adjustments
- **Asset Resolution**: Complex asset paths might not resolve correctly
- **Phaser Integration**: Game engine initialization might conflict with HMR
- **Environment Variables**: Production builds might expose development settings

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Test with existing webpack configuration early and often
- Use incremental development with frequent browser testing
- Implement fallback behaviors for all critical functionality
- Separate development and production code paths clearly

## Success Criteria

The implementation is complete when:
1. **Development Build**: `npm run dev` starts the game successfully
2. **Production Build**: `npm run build` generates optimized bundles
3. **Game Loading**: Game initializes within 3 seconds on standard connections
4. **Hot Reload**: Code changes reload the game within 2 seconds
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for common error scenarios
6. **Cross-Browser**: Game works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
7. **Asset Integration**: All existing assets load correctly
8. **Webpack Compatibility**: No modifications needed to existing webpack.config.js
