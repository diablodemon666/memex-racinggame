# Requirements Document: Modular Architecture Transformation

## Context
The Memex Racing game currently exists as a monolithic 2,241-line HTML file (`claudeweb`) that contains all game logic, rendering, UI, and assets in a single file. This architecture limits maintainability, scalability, and the ability to implement advanced features like hot-reload, external customization, and streaming integration.

The transformation aims to extract this monolithic structure into a professional modular architecture while maintaining all existing functionality, performance characteristics (60 FPS), and the retro pixel art aesthetic.

## Stakeholders
- **Primary**: Game developers, content creators, streamers
- **Secondary**: Players, tournament organizers, modding community

## Requirements

### REQ-001: Project Structure & Build System
**User Story:** As a developer, I want a professional build system so that I can develop, test, and deploy the game efficiently.

**EARS Syntax:**
- When the developer builds the project, the system shall generate optimized production assets
- When the developer starts development mode, the system shall provide hot-reload capabilities
- When assets change, the system shall automatically refresh the browser within 2 seconds
- While in development mode, the system shall provide source maps for debugging

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Build System Configuration
  Scenario: Development Environment Setup
    Given the project has webpack configuration
    When I run "npm run dev"
    Then the development server should start on port 3000
    And hot-reload should be enabled
    And source maps should be available for debugging
    
  Scenario: Production Build
    Given the project is ready for production
    When I run "npm run build"
    Then optimized assets should be generated in dist/
    And bundle size should be less than 2MB total
    And all assets should be properly minified
```

Priority: High
Dependencies: None

### REQ-002: Core Game Engine Modularization
**User Story:** As a developer, I want the game engine separated into logical modules so that I can maintain and extend individual systems independently.

**EARS Syntax:**
- When the game initializes, the GameEngine shall coordinate all subsystems
- When game logic updates, the PhysicsManager shall handle movement and collision detection
- When rendering occurs, the RenderManager shall maintain 60 FPS performance
- While preserving functionality, each module shall be independently testable

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Modular Game Engine
  Scenario: Game Engine Initialization
    Given the modular game engine is configured
    When the game starts
    Then GameEngine should initialize successfully
    And PhysicsManager should be ready for collision detection
    And RenderManager should maintain 60 FPS rendering
    
  Scenario: System Independence
    Given the modular architecture is implemented
    When I modify the PhysicsManager
    Then other systems should not be affected
    And the game should continue to function normally
    
  Scenario: Performance Preservation
    Given the game is running with modular architecture
    When all 6 players are active with power-ups
    Then frame rate should remain at 60 FPS
    And memory usage should not exceed monolithic version by more than 10%
```

Priority: High
Dependencies: REQ-001

### REQ-003: Asset Management System
**User Story:** As a content creator, I want a robust asset management system so that I can easily add, validate, and hot-reload custom assets.

**EARS Syntax:**
- When assets are loaded, the system shall validate dimensions (32x32 or 64x64 pixels)
- When invalid assets are detected, the system shall provide clear error messages
- When assets change during development, the system shall hot-reload without game restart
- While managing assets, the system shall implement LRU caching for performance

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Asset Management
  Scenario: Asset Validation
    Given a sprite asset is being loaded
    When the asset dimensions are not 32x32 or 64x64
    Then the system should reject the asset
    And display a clear validation error message
    
  Scenario: Hot-Reload Functionality
    Given the game is running in development mode
    When I replace a sprite asset
    Then the new asset should appear in-game within 2 seconds
    And the game state should be preserved
    
  Scenario: Performance Optimization
    Given multiple assets are loaded
    When memory usage approaches limits
    Then LRU cache should evict unused assets
    And performance should remain stable
```

Priority: High
Dependencies: REQ-002

### REQ-004: Functionality Preservation
**User Story:** As a player, I want all existing game features to work exactly as before so that the gaming experience remains unchanged.

**EARS Syntax:**
- When the modular version launches, all 6 unique maps shall be available
- When players use skills (Thunder, Fire, Bubble, Magnet, Teleport), effects shall work identically
- When random boosters spawn, the same 8 types shall appear with identical behaviors
- While maintaining pixel-perfect rendering, all visual effects shall remain unchanged

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Functionality Preservation
  Scenario: Complete Feature Parity
    Given the modular version is running
    When I compare with the monolithic version
    Then all 6 unique maps should be identical
    And all 5 player skills should behave the same
    And all 8 booster types should function identically
    
  Scenario: Visual Consistency
    Given both versions are running side by side
    When comparing visual output
    Then pixel-perfect rendering should be maintained
    And all animations should match exactly
    And retro aesthetic should be preserved
    
  Scenario: Performance Equivalence
    Given both versions are running the same race
    When measuring performance metrics
    Then modular version should maintain 60 FPS
    And memory usage should not exceed +10% variance
```

Priority: Critical
Dependencies: REQ-001, REQ-002, REQ-003

### REQ-005: Development Experience Enhancement
**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved development tools so that I can debug and extend the game efficiently.

**EARS Syntax:**
- When debugging, the system shall provide clear module boundaries and error traces
- When code changes, the system shall preserve game state during hot-reload when possible
- When testing, each module shall be independently unit testable
- While developing, the system shall provide comprehensive logging and debug information

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Development Experience
  Scenario: Debug Information
    Given the game is running in development mode
    When an error occurs
    Then the error should be traced to the specific module
    And stack traces should include source map information
    
  Scenario: State Preservation
    Given a race is in progress
    When I modify non-critical game code
    Then the race state should be preserved after hot-reload
    And players should continue from their current positions
    
  Scenario: Module Testing
    Given the modular architecture is implemented
    When I want to test a specific system
    Then I should be able to test it in isolation
    And mock dependencies should be easily injectable
```

Priority: Medium
Dependencies: REQ-001, REQ-002

## Success Criteria
- All existing functionality preserved with zero regression
- 60 FPS performance maintained under all conditions
- Hot-reload implementation working within 2 seconds
- Modular architecture enabling future enhancements
- Developer productivity improved through better debugging and testing capabilities
- Foundation established for external customization system

## Out of Scope (Phase 1)
- New features or gameplay mechanics
- UI/UX changes beyond necessary modularization
- Streaming integration or external APIs
- Advanced camera controls
- Tournament systems
- Custom power-up creation

## Risk Mitigation
- Comprehensive testing strategy comparing modular vs monolithic versions
- Gradual extraction approach with intermediate validation steps
- Performance monitoring throughout transformation process
- Rollback plan if critical issues emerge during development
