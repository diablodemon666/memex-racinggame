# Requirements Document: Week 1 Critical Security & Stability Fixes

## Context
The Memex Racing game has critical security vulnerabilities and stability issues that are blocking production deployment. These issues include missing JWT configuration, lack of password hashing, memory leaks, and 19 failing tests that prevent reliable operation.

## Stakeholders
- **Primary**: Development team, production deployment team
- **Secondary**: Game players, security auditors, operations team

## Requirements

### REQ-001: JWT Secret Configuration Fix
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure JWT configuration so that authentication tokens are properly protected.

**EARS Syntax:**
- When the application starts, the system shall validate that JWT_SECRET environment variable is configured
- When JWT_SECRET is missing or invalid, the system shall fail fast with clear error messages
- If JWT_SECRET is weak or common, then the system shall reject it and provide security guidance

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: JWT Secret Configuration
  Scenario: Missing JWT Secret
    Given no JWT_SECRET environment variable is set
    When the application starts
    Then the system should fail with error "JWT_SECRET environment variable is required"

  Scenario: Weak JWT Secret
    Given JWT_SECRET is set to "password" 
    When the application starts
    Then the system should fail with error "JWT secret is too weak"

  Scenario: Valid JWT Secret
    Given JWT_SECRET is set to a 32+ character secure string
    When the application starts
    Then the authentication system should initialize successfully
```

**Priority:** Critical
**Dependencies:** None

### REQ-002: Password Hashing Implementation
**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my passwords properly hashed so that they cannot be stolen or misused if the database is compromised.

**EARS Syntax:**
- When a user registers, the system shall hash their password using bcrypt with salt rounds >= 12
- When a user logs in, the system shall verify the password against the stored hash
- While storing passwords, the system shall never store plaintext passwords

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Password Security
  Scenario: Password Registration
    Given a user provides password "MySecure123!"
    When they register an account
    Then the password should be hashed with bcrypt
    And the plaintext password should never be stored
    And the hash should use salt rounds >= 12

  Scenario: Password Login Verification
    Given a user has registered with password "MySecure123!"
    When they login with correct password
    Then the system should verify against the stored hash
    And authentication should succeed

  Scenario: Invalid Password Login
    Given a user has registered with password "MySecure123!"
    When they login with incorrect password "WrongPass"
    Then authentication should fail
    And no timing attacks should be possible
```

**Priority:** Critical
**Dependencies:** None

### REQ-003: Memory Leak Resolution
**User Story:** As a system operator, I want memory leaks fixed so that the application runs reliably without degradation over time.

**EARS Syntax:**
- When timers are created, the system shall properly clear them on cleanup
- When event listeners are added, the system shall remove them on component destruction
- While managing JWT refresh tokens, the system shall prevent timer accumulation

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Memory Management
  Scenario: Timer Cleanup
    Given JWT refresh timers are active
    When a user logs out or session ends
    Then all associated timers should be cleared
    And no orphaned timers should remain

  Scenario: Event Listener Cleanup
    Given authentication event listeners are registered
    When the authentication system is destroyed
    Then all event listeners should be removed
    And no memory references should remain

  Scenario: Phaser Tween Cleanup
    Given game tweens are running
    When a scene is destroyed or changed
    Then all tweens should be properly cleaned up
    And no memory leaks should occur
```

**Priority:** Critical
**Dependencies:** None

### REQ-004: Test Suite Stabilization
**User Story:** As a developer, I want all tests passing so that I can confidently deploy code changes.

**EARS Syntax:**
- When tests are run, the system shall pass all 279 existing tests
- When crypto mocking is used, the system shall properly mock crypto.getRandomValues()
- While testing CSRF functionality, the system shall handle request headers correctly

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Test Suite Reliability
  Scenario: Full Test Suite Success
    Given all test files are executed
    When running npm test
    Then all 279 tests should pass
    And no test failures should occur
    And test execution should complete under 60 seconds

  Scenario: Crypto Mocking
    Given crypto functionality needs testing
    When crypto.getRandomValues() is mocked
    Then the mock should be properly called
    And random value generation should work in tests

  Scenario: CSRF Request Testing
    Given CSRF middleware is tested
    When request headers are accessed
    Then undefined headers should be handled gracefully
    And no runtime errors should occur
```

**Priority:** Critical
**Dependencies:** None

### REQ-005: Production Startup Reliability
**User Story:** As a deployment engineer, I want the application to start reliably so that production deployments succeed consistently.

**EARS Syntax:**
- When the application starts in production, the system shall complete initialization within 30 seconds
- When environment variables are missing, the system shall provide clear error messages
- While starting up, the system shall validate all critical dependencies

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Production Startup
  Scenario: Successful Production Start
    Given all required environment variables are set
    When the application starts in production mode
    Then initialization should complete within 30 seconds
    And all services should be healthy
    And the application should be ready to accept requests

  Scenario: Missing Dependencies
    Given a required dependency is missing
    When the application starts
    Then a clear error message should be displayed
    And the application should fail fast
    And troubleshooting guidance should be provided

  Scenario: Health Check Endpoint
    Given the application is running
    When a health check is requested
    Then the system should respond with service status
    And response time should be under 1 second
```

**Priority:** Critical
**Dependencies:** REQ-001, REQ-002, REQ-003, REQ-004

## Quality Metrics
- **Test Success Rate**: 100% (279/279 tests passing)
- **Startup Time**: < 30 seconds in production
- **Memory Stability**: No memory leaks over 24-hour period
- **Security**: No plaintext passwords, secure JWT configuration

## Security Considerations
- JWT secrets must be cryptographically secure (32+ characters)
- Password hashing must use industry-standard bcrypt with proper salt rounds
- No sensitive data should be logged or exposed in error messages
- Timing attacks must be prevented in authentication flows

## Performance Requirements
- Application startup: < 30 seconds
- Test suite execution: < 60 seconds
- Memory usage: Stable over time (no leaks)
- Authentication response: < 500ms

## Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing user accounts
- Cannot break existing game functionality
- Must work in both development and production environments
- Changes must be testable and verifiable
