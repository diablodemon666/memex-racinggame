# Requirements Document: Multi-Phase Game Enhancement

## Context
The Memex Racing game requires a comprehensive enhancement with three major phases: updating the dynamic map system to use real assets, implementing a complete authentication system, and integrating user-centric UI features. This enhancement will transform the game from using mock data to a fully functional, user-authenticated racing platform.

## Stakeholders
- **Primary**: Game players and content creators
- **Secondary**: System administrators, developers maintaining the codebase

## Requirements

### REQ-001: Dynamic Map System Asset Integration
**User Story:** As a game developer, I want the TrackTemplateManager to load actual map assets instead of mock data so that the game displays real track templates and backgrounds.

**EARS Syntax:**
- When the TrackTemplateManager initializes, the system shall scan the maps/tracks/ directory for template1.png through template10.png files
- When the TrackTemplateManager loads backgrounds, the system shall scan the maps/backgrounds/ directory for map1.jpeg through map10.png files
- While scanning assets, when both JPEG and PNG formats are encountered, the system shall support loading both formats seamlessly
- If white pixel template validation fails, then the system shall fallback to legacy collision map format

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Real Asset Loading
  Scenario: Load actual track templates
    Given the TrackTemplateManager is initializing
    When it scans the maps/tracks/ directory
    Then it should find template1.png through template10.png
    And it should create template metadata for each file
    And it should remove all mock template data

  Scenario: Load background images with mixed formats
    Given the system is scanning background assets
    When it encounters both JPEG and PNG files
    Then it should load map1.jpeg, map2.jpeg, map4.jpeg, map5.jpeg, map6.jpeg, map7.jpeg
    And it should load map3.png, map8.png, map9.png, map10.png
    And AssetManager should support both formats seamlessly

  Scenario: White pixel collision validation
    Given a track template is loaded
    When the system validates collision data
    Then it should check for white pixels representing driveable areas
    And it should reject templates without proper white pixel tracks
    And it should provide fallback to legacy collision format if needed
```

**Priority:** High
**Dependencies:** Existing TrackTemplateManager and AssetManager

### REQ-002: Authentication System Implementation
**User Story:** As a player, I want to create an account and login so that my game progress, statistics, and achievements are saved and tracked across sessions.

**EARS Syntax:**
- When a new user accesses the game, the system shall present a login/register screen before game access
- When a user provides credentials, the system shall authenticate using JWT token management
- While a user session is active, the system shall track game statistics per user account
- If authentication fails, then the system shall display appropriate error messages and retry options

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: User Authentication
  Scenario: New user registration
    Given I am a new user accessing the game
    When I click "Register" 
    Then I should see a registration form
    And I should be able to enter username, email, and password
    And upon submission, a new account should be created
    And I should receive a JWT token for session management

  Scenario: Existing user login
    Given I am a returning user
    When I enter my correct credentials
    Then the system should authenticate me
    And I should receive a valid JWT token
    And I should be redirected to the game interface
    And my previous game statistics should be loaded

  Scenario: Profile and statistics tracking
    Given I am logged in
    When I play races
    Then my wins, losses, and performance should be tracked
    And my statistics should persist across sessions
    And I should be able to view my profile and game history

  Scenario: Session management
    Given I have an active session
    When my JWT token expires
    Then I should be prompted to re-authenticate
    And my game progress should be preserved
    And I should be able to continue seamlessly after re-authentication
```

**Priority:** High
**Dependencies:** None (new system)

### REQ-003: Authentication UI Components
**User Story:** As a player, I want intuitive login/register screens and profile management so that account management is simple and user-friendly.

**EARS Syntax:**
- When the game starts, if no valid authentication exists, the system shall display the login screen
- When a user clicks register, the system shall show a registration form with validation
- While a user is authenticated, the system shall display user profile information in the game UI
- If a user wants to logout, then the system shall clear credentials and return to login screen

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Authentication UI
  Scenario: Login screen presentation
    Given I start the game without authentication
    When the game loads
    Then I should see a login screen with username and password fields
    And I should see "Login" and "Register" buttons
    And the game interface should be hidden until authentication

  Scenario: Registration form validation
    Given I click "Register"
    When I enter registration details
    Then the form should validate email format
    And the form should check password strength
    And the form should confirm password matching
    And it should show validation errors if requirements not met

  Scenario: Profile display in game
    Given I am logged in and playing
    When I look at the game interface
    Then I should see my username displayed
    And I should see my current statistics
    And I should have access to profile management options

  Scenario: Logout functionality
    Given I am logged in
    When I choose to logout
    Then my JWT token should be cleared
    And I should return to the login screen
    And local storage should be cleared of credentials
```

**Priority:** Medium
**Dependencies:** REQ-002

### REQ-004: User Progress Integration
**User Story:** As a player, I want my race results and leaderboard position saved to my account so that I can track my improvement over time.

**EARS Syntax:**
- When a race completes, the system shall save race results to the authenticated user's profile
- When displaying leaderboards, the system shall show user-specific rankings and statistics
- While a user is playing, the system shall update their real-time statistics
- If connection is lost during gameplay, then the system shall queue progress updates for later synchronization

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Progress Integration
  Scenario: Race result saving
    Given I complete a race while logged in
    When the race ends
    Then my result should be saved to my user profile
    And my overall statistics should be updated
    And the leaderboard should reflect my new standing

  Scenario: Leaderboard with user accounts
    Given multiple users have played races
    When I view the leaderboard
    Then I should see usernames instead of anonymous players
    And I should see my own ranking highlighted
    And I should be able to view other players' profiles

  Scenario: Statistics persistence
    Given I play multiple races across different sessions
    When I login on different occasions
    Then all my historical race data should be available
    And my cumulative statistics should be accurate
    And I should see trends in my performance over time

  Scenario: Offline/online synchronization
    Given I lose internet connection during a race
    When the race completes
    Then the system should queue my results locally
    And when connection is restored, results should sync automatically
    And no progress should be lost
```

**Priority:** Medium
**Dependencies:** REQ-002, REQ-003

### REQ-005: Local Storage and Session Management
**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to remember my login and preferences so that I don't have to re-enter credentials every time I play.

**EARS Syntax:**
- When a user successfully authenticates, the system shall store JWT tokens in secure local storage
- When the game starts, if valid tokens exist, the system shall automatically authenticate the user
- While tokens are stored, the system shall periodically validate token expiration
- If stored tokens are invalid or expired, then the system shall prompt for re-authentication

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Session Management
  Scenario: Automatic login with stored credentials
    Given I previously logged in and chose "Remember Me"
    When I restart the game
    Then I should be automatically logged in
    And I should see my profile information
    And I should not see the login screen

  Scenario: Token expiration handling
    Given I have an expired JWT token stored
    When I start the game
    Then the system should detect the expired token
    And I should be prompted to login again
    And the expired token should be cleared from storage

  Scenario: Secure credential storage
    Given I login with credentials
    When the system stores authentication data
    Then sensitive information should be properly encrypted
    And JWT tokens should follow security best practices
    And personal data should be handled according to privacy standards

  Scenario: Manual logout clears storage
    Given I am logged in with stored credentials
    When I choose to logout
    Then all stored authentication data should be cleared
    And on next visit, I should see the login screen
    And no automatic authentication should occur
```

**Priority:** Medium
**Dependencies:** REQ-002

## System Architecture Requirements

### REQ-006: Authentication Configuration
**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable authentication settings so that the system can be adapted for different deployment environments.

**EARS Syntax:**
- When the authentication system initializes, it shall load configuration from authentication.json
- When JWT tokens are generated, the system shall use configurable expiration times and secrets
- While handling authentication, the system shall support configurable password requirements
- If configuration is invalid, then the system shall use secure defaults and log warnings

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Authentication Configuration
  Scenario: Configuration file loading
    Given the authentication system starts
    When it looks for authentication.json
    Then it should load JWT secret, expiration times, and password rules
    And it should validate configuration parameters
    And it should apply settings to authentication operations

  Scenario: Environment-specific settings
    Given different deployment environments (dev, staging, prod)
    When the system initializes authentication
    Then it should use environment-appropriate JWT secrets
    And token expiration should vary by environment
    And password complexity should be configurable per environment
```

**Priority:** Low
**Dependencies:** REQ-002

## Technical Constraints

1. **Performance**: Authentication operations must not impact game performance (sub-100ms response times)
2. **Security**: JWT tokens must follow industry security standards
3. **Compatibility**: Must work with existing modular architecture
4. **Scalability**: Support for future multi-server deployment
5. **Asset Loading**: Dynamic map system must maintain backward compatibility

## Success Metrics

1. **Functionality**: 100% of track templates and backgrounds load correctly from real assets
2. **Authentication**: Sub-2 second login/registration experience
3. **Session Management**: 99%+ session persistence reliability
4. **User Experience**: Zero authentication-related game interruptions
5. **Performance**: No measurable impact on 60 FPS game performance target

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Asset Loading Failure**: Implement robust fallback to legacy system
2. **Authentication Service Downtime**: Local credential caching with graceful degradation
3. **JWT Token Compromise**: Token rotation and secure storage practices
4. **User Data Loss**: Regular backup and synchronization mechanisms
5. **Performance Impact**: Lazy loading and background processing for auth operations
