# Requirements Document: Game Engine Integration

## Context
The Memex Racing game has a complete authentication system (TASK-001 through TASK-007) but lacks proper integration between the authentication system and the game engine. The authentication is currently isolated and doesn't properly integrate with Phaser.js game scenes, making it impossible for authenticated users to actually play the game. This critical integration task (TASK-008) is blocking the transition from authentication to gameplay.

## Stakeholders
- **Primary**: Game players who need seamless auth-to-game experience
- **Secondary**: Developers maintaining the integration between auth and game systems
- **Tertiary**: Multiplayer system that depends on authenticated user data

## Requirements

### REQ-001: Seamless Authentication Flow Integration
**User Story:** As a player, I want to log in and immediately access the game without additional steps so that I can start playing quickly

**EARS Syntax:**
- When a user successfully authenticates, the system shall automatically initialize the game with user context
- If authentication fails, then the system shall prevent game access and redirect to login
- While the user is authenticated, when they access the game, the system shall provide user data to all game scenes

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Authentication to Game Flow
  Scenario: Successful authentication leads to game access
    Given a user has valid credentials
    When they complete the login process
    Then the game should initialize with their user profile
    And all game scenes should receive user data
    And multiplayer connection should use authenticated user ID

  Scenario: Failed authentication blocks game access
    Given a user has invalid credentials
    When they attempt to log in
    Then the game should not initialize
    And they should remain on the login screen
    And no game resources should be loaded
```

**Priority**: High
**Dependencies**: Completed authentication system (TASK-001 to TASK-007)

### REQ-002: User Context Propagation Through Game Scenes
**User Story:** As a player, I want my profile data to be available throughout the game so that my statistics and preferences are maintained

**EARS Syntax:**
- When the game initializes, the system shall pass authenticated user data to all Phaser scenes
- While a user is playing, when scene transitions occur, the system shall preserve user context
- If user data becomes unavailable during gameplay, then the system shall gracefully handle the session expiration

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: User Context in Game Scenes
  Scenario: User data available in all scenes
    Given a user is authenticated and game is initialized
    When they navigate between different game scenes
    Then their user profile should be accessible in each scene
    And their statistics should be properly displayed
    And their game preferences should be applied

  Scenario: Session expiration during gameplay
    Given a user is playing the game
    When their authentication session expires
    Then the game should pause gracefully
    And they should be prompted to re-authenticate
    And their current game progress should be preserved if possible
```

**Priority**: High
**Dependencies**: REQ-001

### REQ-003: Game Engine Authentication State Management
**User Story:** As a developer, I want the game engine to properly manage authentication states so that the system is reliable and secure

**EARS Syntax:**
- When authentication state changes, the system shall update all relevant game components
- While the game is running, when user logs out, the system shall clean up user-specific data
- If authentication is required, then the system shall validate user tokens before allowing game actions

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Authentication State Management
  Scenario: Authentication state change handling
    Given the game is running with an authenticated user
    When the user logs out
    Then all user-specific game data should be cleared
    And the game should return to the main menu
    And multiplayer connections should be terminated

  Scenario: Token validation during gameplay
    Given a user is playing the game
    When they perform actions requiring authentication
    Then the system should validate their current token
    And invalid tokens should trigger re-authentication
    And valid tokens should allow the action to proceed
```

**Priority**: Medium
**Dependencies**: REQ-001, REQ-002

### REQ-004: Error Handling and Recovery Integration
**User Story:** As a player, I want authentication errors to be handled gracefully so that I don't lose my game progress unnecessarily

**EARS Syntax:**
- When authentication errors occur during gameplay, the system shall provide clear error messages
- If network connectivity is lost, then the system shall attempt to reconnect and restore authentication
- While authentication is being restored, when possible, the system shall preserve game state

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Authentication Error Handling
  Scenario: Network connectivity loss during game
    Given a user is playing an online game
    When network connectivity is lost
    Then the game should pause and show connection status
    And authentication should attempt to reconnect automatically
    And game state should be preserved where possible

  Scenario: Authentication server errors
    Given a user is playing the game
    When the authentication server becomes unavailable
    Then the user should see an informative error message
    And they should have options to retry or continue offline if applicable
    And their current progress should not be lost
```

**Priority**: Medium
**Dependencies**: REQ-001, REQ-002, REQ-003

## System Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Must integrate with existing Phaser.js game architecture
- Must preserve existing authentication API without breaking changes
- Must maintain 60 FPS game performance during authentication operations
- Must support hot module replacement in development environment

### Security Constraints
- All authentication tokens must be securely stored and transmitted
- User data must be properly sanitized before use in game context
- Session management must prevent unauthorized access to game features
- Authentication state must be validated before sensitive game operations

### Performance Constraints
- Authentication integration must not add more than 100ms to game initialization
- Scene transitions must complete within 500ms regardless of authentication status
- Memory usage for authentication context must not exceed 5MB
- Network requests for authentication must be optimized for game flow

## Success Criteria

1. **Seamless Integration**: Users can log in and immediately start playing without additional steps
2. **Context Preservation**: User data is available and consistent across all game scenes
3. **Error Resilience**: Authentication errors are handled gracefully without game crashes
4. **Performance Maintained**: Game runs at 60 FPS with authentication integration active
5. **Security Compliance**: All authentication operations follow security best practices
6. **Development Experience**: Integration supports hot module replacement and debugging tools

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Session Expiration During Gameplay**: Could interrupt user experience and cause data loss
- **Authentication Server Downtime**: Could prevent game access entirely
- **Token Security**: Improper handling could lead to security vulnerabilities

### Medium Risk
- **Performance Impact**: Authentication checks could slow down game operations
- **State Synchronization**: Mismatched authentication and game states could cause errors
- **Network Latency**: Slow authentication responses could impact game initialization

### Low Risk
- **User Interface Updates**: Changes to UI might confuse existing users
- **Development Workflow**: Integration might complicate hot reload functionality

## Implementation Notes

### Integration Points
1. **Game Initialization**: src/index.js initializeGame() function
2. **Scene Management**: All Phaser scenes need user context access
3. **Multiplayer Connection**: Authentication data must connect to multiplayer system
4. **Error Boundaries**: Existing error handling must cover authentication failures
5. **Development Tools**: Debug tools must support authentication workflow
