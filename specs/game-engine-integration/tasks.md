  4. Implement enhanced MainMenuScene
  5. Refactor for consistency and user experience
- **Acceptance Test**:
  ```gherkin
  Given a user is authenticated and on main menu
  When they view the scene
  Then their user info should be displayed correctly
  And they should have access to logout functionality
  When their session expires
  Then they should be handled gracefully
  ```

## Implementation Notes

### Security Considerations
- JWT tokens must never be exposed to game logic
- All user data must be sanitized before use in game context
- Session validation must occur before sensitive operations
- Permission checks must be enforced for multiplayer actions

### Performance Requirements
- Auth integration must not add more than 100ms to game initialization
- User context updates must not impact 60 FPS gameplay
- Memory usage for auth context must remain under 5MB
- Scene transitions must complete within 500ms

### Testing Strategy
- Each task follows strict TDD methodology
- Integration tests cover complete auth-to-game flow
- Error scenarios are tested with graceful degradation
- Performance testing ensures no regression in game performance

### Success Metrics
- 100% auth integration across all game features
- Zero user progress lost during auth operations
- All authentication errors handled gracefully
- Maintained 60 FPS performance with auth integration
