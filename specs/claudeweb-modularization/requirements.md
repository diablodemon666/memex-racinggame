# Requirements Document: Claudeweb Modularization

## Context
The current Memex Racing game implementation exists as a 2,241-line monolithic HTML file (claudeweb) containing a complete racing game with betting, leaderboards, multiple maps, and player customization. This monolith needs to be decomposed into the existing modular architecture following established patterns in the src/ directory while preserving all game functionality and improving performance, maintainability, and testability.

## Stakeholders
- **Primary**: Game developers, system architects, performance engineers
- **Secondary**: Game testers, DevOps engineers, end users expecting seamless transition

## Requirements

### REQ-001: Complete Feature Preservation
**User Story:** As a game player, I want all existing claudeweb features to work identically after modularization so that my gaming experience remains unchanged.

**EARS Syntax:**
- When the modular system loads, the system shall provide all 6 racing maps with identical layouts and rotation mechanics
- When a player customizes their character, the system shall maintain the same customization options and persistence
- When betting occurs, the system shall preserve the exact betting mechanics and leaderboard calculations
- While racing, when players use skills or collect boosters, the system shall maintain identical gameplay mechanics

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Complete Feature Preservation
  Scenario: All maps function identically
    Given the modular system is loaded
    When I press 'M' to access map selection
    Then I should see all 6 maps with correct previews and difficulty ratings
    And map rotation should occur every 3 races as before

  Scenario: Player customization preserved
    Given I am in the player setup interface
    When I customize my player name and image
    Then the customization should persist across game sessions
    And custom images should display correctly in races

  Scenario: Betting system functions identically
    Given a race is in betting phase
    When I place bets on different players
    Then the betting mechanics should work exactly as in claudeweb
    And leaderboard calculations should produce identical results
```

**Priority:** High
**Dependencies:** None

### REQ-002: Modular Architecture Integration
**User Story:** As a developer, I want claudeweb functionality integrated into the existing src/ modular architecture so that the codebase follows established patterns and conventions.

**EARS Syntax:**
- When integrating with GameEngine, the system shall use established engine patterns and lifecycle management
- When creating game scenes, the system shall extend existing scene classes and follow scene management protocols
- When implementing multiplayer features, the system shall integrate with existing MultiplayerManager and RoomManager
- If new systems are needed, then the system shall follow existing naming conventions and module structure

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Modular Architecture Integration
  Scenario: GameEngine integration
    Given the modular racing system is initialized
    When GameEngine.start() is called
    Then the racing scenes should load using established scene management
    And all game systems should follow existing lifecycle patterns

  Scenario: Scene structure compliance
    Given the racing functionality is modularized
    When examining the scene hierarchy
    Then RaceScene should extend AuthenticatedScene
    And all scenes should follow established patterns from src/game/scenes/

  Scenario: System integration compliance
    Given the modular components are implemented
    When examining system dependencies
    Then all systems should integrate with ConfigManager
    And multiplayer features should use existing MultiplayerManager
```

**Priority:** High
**Dependencies:** REQ-001

### REQ-003: Performance Optimization
**User Story:** As a game player, I want improved performance with 60 FPS gameplay and reduced memory usage so that the game runs smoothly on various devices.

**EARS Syntax:**
- When the game is running, the system shall maintain consistent 60 FPS performance
- When memory usage is monitored, the system shall not exceed 512MB total memory consumption
- When assets are loaded, the system shall implement efficient caching and disposal patterns
- If performance degrades, then the system shall provide performance monitoring and automatic optimization

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Performance Optimization
  Scenario: Frame rate consistency
    Given a race is active with 6 players
    When monitoring frame rate during gameplay
    Then the system should maintain 60 FPS consistently
    And frame drops should not exceed 5% of total frames

  Scenario: Memory management
    Given the game has been running for 30 minutes
    When monitoring memory usage
    Then memory consumption should not exceed 512MB
    And memory leaks should be prevented through proper cleanup

  Scenario: Asset optimization
    Given multiple races have occurred
    When examining asset loading patterns
    Then unused assets should be properly disposed
    And sprite caching should optimize rendering performance
```

**Priority:** High
**Dependencies:** REQ-002

### REQ-004: Comprehensive Test Coverage
**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage following TDD principles so that the modular system is reliable and maintainable.

**EARS Syntax:**
- When code is written, the system shall follow TDD Red-Green-Refactor methodology
- When tests are executed, the system shall achieve minimum 80% code coverage
- When integration tests run, the system shall validate all game mechanics and multiplayer features
- If tests fail, then the system shall provide clear error messages and debugging information

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Comprehensive Test Coverage
  Scenario: TDD compliance
    Given new functionality is being implemented
    When following development process
    Then tests should be written before implementation code
    And all tests should follow Red-Green-Refactor cycle

  Scenario: Coverage targets
    Given all modular components are implemented
    When running test coverage analysis
    Then code coverage should exceed 80%
    And critical game mechanics should have 100% coverage

  Scenario: Integration testing
    Given the complete modular system is implemented
    When running integration tests
    Then all game phases should be validated
    And multiplayer scenarios should be thoroughly tested
```

**Priority:** Medium
**Dependencies:** REQ-001, REQ-002

### REQ-005: Security and Anti-Cheat Implementation
**User Story:** As a game operator, I want server-side validation and anti-cheat measures so that game integrity is maintained and cheating is prevented.

**EARS Syntax:**
- When player actions are submitted, the system shall validate all actions server-side
- When game state changes occur, the system shall verify legitimacy before applying changes
- When suspicious patterns are detected, the system shall implement appropriate countermeasures
- If cheating attempts are identified, then the system shall log incidents and take corrective action

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Security and Anti-Cheat
  Scenario: Server-side validation
    Given a player attempts to submit a game action
    When the action is processed
    Then the server should validate action legitimacy
    And invalid actions should be rejected with appropriate logging

  Scenario: Game state integrity
    Given game state modifications are attempted
    When processing state changes
    Then all changes should be verified against game rules
    And inconsistent states should be automatically corrected

  Scenario: Cheat detection
    Given suspicious player behavior patterns
    When monitoring system detects anomalies
    Then appropriate countermeasures should be activated
    And incidents should be logged for analysis
```

**Priority:** Medium
