# Requirements Document: Progress Tracking System

## Context
The Memex Racing game needs a comprehensive progress tracking system that records user statistics, manages player profiles, and provides leaderboard functionality. Currently, user data exists in the authentication system, but there's no persistent tracking of game performance, achievements, or competitive rankings. This system will motivate players through progression mechanics and provide social features through leaderboards.

## Stakeholders
- **Primary**: Game players who want to track their improvement and compete with others
- **Secondary**: Game administrators who need analytics and user engagement data
- **Tertiary**: Social gamers who want to compare achievements with friends

## Requirements

### REQ-001: User Profile Management
**User Story:** As a player, I want to have a persistent profile that tracks my gaming history so that I can see my progress over time

**EARS Syntax:**
- When a user completes a race, the system shall update their profile with race statistics
- While a user is playing, when they achieve milestones, the system shall record achievements
- If profile data becomes corrupted, then the system shall restore from backup or provide recovery options

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: User Profile Management
  Scenario: Profile data persistence across sessions
    Given a user has played several races
    When they log out and log back in
    Then their profile should show all previous statistics
    And their achievement progress should be maintained
    And their best times should be preserved

  Scenario: Profile data corruption recovery
    Given a user's profile data becomes corrupted
    When they attempt to access their profile
    Then the system should detect the corruption
    And attempt to restore from backup
    And notify the user of any data loss
```

**Priority**: High
**Dependencies**: Completed authentication system

### REQ-002: Real-time Statistics Tracking
**User Story:** As a player, I want my race performance to be tracked automatically so that I can focus on playing rather than manual record-keeping

**EARS Syntax:**
- When a race starts, the system shall begin tracking player performance metrics
- While a race is in progress, when significant events occur, the system shall record them
- When a race ends, the system shall calculate and store comprehensive statistics

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Real-time Statistics Tracking
  Scenario: Automatic race statistic collection
    Given a race is in progress
    When race events occur (collisions, power-ups, position changes)
    Then all events should be automatically tracked
    And performance metrics should be calculated in real-time
    And no manual intervention should be required

  Scenario: Race completion statistics
    Given a race has ended
    When the system processes the results
    Then final statistics should be calculated and stored
    And personal bests should be updated if improved
    And the data should be immediately available in the user profile
```

**Priority**: High
**Dependencies**: REQ-001

### REQ-003: Achievement System
**User Story:** As a player, I want to unlock achievements for accomplishing specific goals so that I have additional motivation to improve

**EARS Syntax:**
- When a user performs achievement-worthy actions, the system shall check for achievement completion
- If an achievement is unlocked, then the system shall notify the user and update their profile
- While achievements are being processed, when multiple achievements are earned simultaneously, the system shall handle them efficiently

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Achievement System
  Scenario: Achievement unlock notification
    Given a user completes a race that qualifies for an achievement
    When the race results are processed
    Then any unlocked achievements should be identified
    And the user should be notified with visual feedback
    And the achievement should be added to their profile

  Scenario: Multiple simultaneous achievements
    Given a user's action qualifies for multiple achievements
    When the achievement system processes the action
    Then all applicable achievements should be unlocked
    And the user should see all achievement notifications
    And the profile should reflect all new achievements
```

**Priority**: Medium
**Dependencies**: REQ-001, REQ-002

### REQ-004: Leaderboard System
**User Story:** As a player, I want to see how I rank against other players so that I can set competitive goals

**EARS Syntax:**
- When race results are recorded, the system shall update relevant leaderboards
- While leaderboards are displayed, when data is requested, the system shall show current rankings
- If leaderboard data is temporarily unavailable, then the system shall show cached rankings with appropriate indicators

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Leaderboard System
  Scenario: Real-time leaderboard updates
    Given multiple players are completing races
    When race results are processed
    Then leaderboards should be updated immediately
    And player rankings should reflect the latest results
    And ties should be handled with consistent rules

  Scenario: Multiple leaderboard categories
    Given the game tracks various statistics
    When a player views leaderboards
    Then they should see rankings for different categories (fastest times, most wins, etc.)
    And they should be able to filter by time period
    And their own ranking should be clearly highlighted
```

**Priority**: Medium
**Dependencies**: REQ-001, REQ-002

### REQ-005: Performance Analytics
**User Story:** As a player, I want detailed analytics of my performance so that I can identify areas for improvement

**EARS Syntax:**
- When sufficient race data is available, the system shall generate performance analytics
- While analytics are being calculated, when trends are identified, the system shall highlight them
- If analytics processing fails, then the system shall provide basic statistics as fallback

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Performance Analytics
  Scenario: Trend analysis over time
    Given a user has played races over multiple sessions
    When they view their analytics
    Then they should see performance trends over time
    And improvement or decline should be clearly indicated
    And specific areas of strength and weakness should be identified

  Scenario: Comparative analytics
    Given a user wants to compare their performance
    When they access comparative analytics
    Then they should see how they perform relative to similar players
    And suggestions for improvement should be provided
    And progress toward goals should be tracked
```

**Priority**: Low
**Dependencies**: REQ-001, REQ-002

### REQ-006: Data Export and Privacy
**User Story:** As a player, I want to control my data and optionally export it so that I maintain ownership of my gaming history

**EARS Syntax:**
- When a user requests data export, the system shall provide their complete profile data
- If a user wants to delete their data, then the system shall remove all personal information while preserving anonymous statistics
- While handling data requests, when privacy settings are configured, the system shall respect user preferences

**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format):**
```gherkin
Feature: Data Export and Privacy
  Scenario: Complete data export
    Given a user requests to export their data
    When the export process runs
    Then they should receive a complete file with all their statistics
    And the data should be in a readable format (JSON/CSV)
    And no sensitive information should be included

  Scenario: Data deletion request
    Given a user wants to delete their account data
    When they confirm the deletion request
    Then all personal information should be removed
    And anonymous statistics can be retained for game analytics
    And the deletion should be irreversible and complete
```

**Priority**: Low
**Dependencies**: REQ-001
