    When the scene loads
    Then it should load separate modules for movement, UI, physics
    And each module should have clear interfaces
    And dependencies should be explicitly defined

  Scenario: Resource Cleanup
    Given I am transitioning from race scene to lobby
    When the scene change occurs
    Then all race scene resources should be cleaned up
    And memory usage should return to baseline
    And no orphaned objects should remain

  Scenario: Error Isolation
    Given an error occurs in the UI module
    When the error is thrown
    Then game physics should continue working
