# GitHub Authentication Fix

To fix the authentication issue, you need to create a Personal Access Token:

## Steps:

1. **Create a Personal Access Token**:
   - Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give it a name like "Memex Racing Deployment"
   - Select scopes:
     - ✅ repo (all)
     - ✅ workflow
   - Click "Generate token"
   - **COPY THE TOKEN** (you won't see it again!)

2. **Update your Git remote** (replace YOUR_TOKEN with the actual token):
   ```bash
   cd "/Volumes/MOVESPEED/Memex Racing game"
   git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/diablodemon666/memex-racinggame.git
   ```

3. **Push your changes**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

## Alternative: Use GitHub Desktop

If you prefer not to deal with tokens, just use GitHub Desktop:
1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. It should show your pending commit
3. Click "Push origin"

GitHub Desktop handles authentication automatically through your logged-in session.

## Security Note

If using a token:
- Keep it secure and don't share it
- You can revoke it anytime from GitHub settings
- Consider using GitHub Desktop for easier authentication
