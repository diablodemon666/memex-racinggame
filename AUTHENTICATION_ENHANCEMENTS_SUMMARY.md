const auth = createEnhancedAuthManager({
  jwt: { secret: process.env.JWT_SECRET },
  security: { environment: 'production' }
});

// Register user with enhanced security
const result = await auth.register({
  username: 'player123',
  email: 'player@example.com',
  password: 'SecurePassword123!'
}, {
  ipAddress: '192.168.1.1',
  userAgent: 'Mozilla/5.0...'
});

// Login with security monitoring
const loginResult = await auth.login({
  username: 'player123',
  password: 'SecurePassword123!'
}, {
  ipAddress: '192.168.1.1',
  rememberMe: true
});
```

### Role-Based Access Control
```javascript
// Check user permissions
const canPlaceHighBets = auth.hasPermission(userId, 'betting.high_stakes');
const canModerateChat = auth.hasRole(userId, 'moderator');

// Assign temporary role
auth.assignUserRole(userId, 'vip', {
  temporary: true,
  expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // 24 hours
});
```

### Security Monitoring
```javascript
// Listen for security events
auth.on('securityViolation', (event) => {
  console.log('Security violation detected:', event);
  // Take appropriate action
});

// Get security statistics
const stats = auth.getSystemStats();
console.log('Security metrics:', stats);
```
